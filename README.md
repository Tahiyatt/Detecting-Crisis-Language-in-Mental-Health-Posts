# Detecting-Crisis-Language-in-Mental-Health-Posts
_Develop a machine learning classifier to detect crisis-related language in Reddit mental health posts (e.g., self-harm, suicidal ideation) to support early intervention and public health monitoring. 
Focus on natural language processing, ethical AI, and sensitive content detection._

## 🏗️ **Project Overview**

**Describe:**
<!--
- How this project is connected to the Break Through Tech AI Program
- Your AI Studio host company and the project objective and scope
- The real-world significance of the problem and the potential impact of your work
-->

This project is part of the **Break Through Tech AI Program**, where we apply machine learning to real-world public health challenges. The project aims to leverage publicly 
available Reddit data to identify potential linguistic and behavioral signals of depression. By building a Python-based pipeline using the **Reddit API (PRAW)**, we will collect posts
and comments from targeted subreddits, preprocess the data, and develop a machine learning classifier to detect depression-related language.

**AI Studio Host Company & Project Scope:**

In collaboration with our **AI Studio host company**, our objective is to build an end-to-end system that can pull Reddit posts, preprocess the data, and apply a depression-signal classifier.
The project focuses on using NLP techniques such as **TF-IDF with logistic regression** and **transformer-based models** to classify posts as likely containing depression-related language. The target performance 
is to achieve at least **70% accuracy** on a labeled validation set.

**Real-World Significance:**

This work has significant real-world implications in the field of public health, as social media platforms like Reddit are increasingly used by individuals to express emotional distress. 
By identifying depression-related signals in posts, we aim to enable early intervention and support, contributing to **ethical AI** development and **data-driven public health insights**. 
Additionally, the project focuses on addressing privacy concerns and bias detection to ensure responsible use of this technology.
