        "# NLP-Depression-Detection: Project Plan\n",
        "\n",
        "##  **Project Overview**\n",
        "This project explores how publicly available Reddit posts can be analyzed to identify linguistic and behavioral signals of depression. We will build a machine learning classifier to distinguish between posts likely containing depression-related language and those that do not. The goal is to demonstrate how social media data can be leveraged for public health insights, while maintaining strict ethical and privacy standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "##  **Objective**\n",
        "- **Data Collection**: Build a Python-based pipeline using the Reddit API (PRAW) to collect posts and comments from targeted subreddits.\n",
        "- **Modeling**: Develop and evaluate a depression-signal classifier using NLP techniques (e.g., TF-IDF + logistic regression, transformer-based models). Target performance: **70% accuracy** on a labeled validation set.\n",
        "- **Visualization & Insights**: Create visualizations and narratives linking classifier outputs to patterns and trends over time, with attention to ethical considerations and bias detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "##  **Desired Outcomes**\n",
        "By **December**, the team will present:\n",
        "- **End-to-end pipeline**: Collects Reddit posts, preprocesses text, and applies the depression-signal classifier.\n",
        "- **Evaluation metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with error analysis.\n",
        "- **Visual Dashboards/Reports**: Show how depression-related signals fluctuate over time and across communities, along with recommendations for ethical use in public health.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "##  **Suggested Machine Learning Approach**\n",
        "- **Type of ML problem**: Supervised learning for classifying Reddit posts as depression-related or not.\n",
        "- **Recommended Models**:\n",
        "  1. **Baseline**: Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes + TF-IDF.\n",
        "  2. **Intermediate**: Random Forest or XGBoost.\n",
        "  3. **Advanced**: Fine-tune BERT or DistilBERT.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
        "  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.\n",
        "  - Focus on **balancing false positives and false negatives**, especially in the mental health context.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "##  **Data Overview**\n",
        "- **Source**: Public Reddit posts from mental health-related subreddits (e.g., r/depression, r/mentalhealth, r/SuicideWatch).\n",
        "- **Format**: JSON or CSV export containing:\n",
        "  - Post text\n",
        "  - Timestamps\n",
        "  - Subreddit name\n",
        "  - Engagement metrics (e.g., upvotes, comments)\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Data Quality Considerations**\n",
        "- **Text**: Posts may contain slang, abbreviations, or misspellings that can affect NLP accuracy.\n",
        "- **Class Imbalance**: Fewer non-depression-related posts compared to depression-related ones.\n",
        "- **Ethics**: Data must be **anonymized**, removing personally identifiable information (PII).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "##  **Preprocessing Needs**\n",
        "- **Text Cleaning**: Remove URLs, HTML tags, and emojis.\n",
        "- **Tokenization & Normalization**: Lowercase, stemming/lemmatization.\n",
        "- **Class Imbalance**: Address this for classifier training (e.g., oversampling, undersampling).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "##  **Data Access & Authentication**\n",
        "- **API**: We will authenticate with the Reddit API using the Python **PRAW** library.\n",
        "- **Documentation**:\n",
